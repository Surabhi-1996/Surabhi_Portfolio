# [Project1: Employee Retention Prediction Project](https://github.com/Surabhi-1996/Human_Resources)
- Hiring and retaining employees are extreemly complex tasks that requires capital, time and skills.
- The HR team have collected extensive data on their employees and approched to develop a model that could predict which employees are most likely to quit.
- Explore and visualize dataset
- Data cleaning to remove the unwanted features
- Training and evaluating models using below algorithms:
  - Logistic Regression 
  - RandomForestClassifier
  - Deep Learning model using Keras


# [Project2: Movie Review using Text Classification Method](https://github.com/Surabhi-1996/movie_review1)

## In this project we'll try to develop a classification model - that is, we'll try to predict the Positive/Negative labels based on text content alone for movie review dataset.

- The dataset contains the text of 2000 movie reviews. 1000 are positive, 1000 are negative, and the text.
- Data cleaning to remove missing values and empty strings.
- Build pipelines to vectorize the data, then train and fit a model
- Feed the training data through the pipeline of below models
  - Naive Bayes
  - Linear SVC
-Run predictions and analyze the results
